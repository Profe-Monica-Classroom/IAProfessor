# Odoo Partners Scraper

This project is designed to scrape data from the Odoo partners website, manage the scraped data in a dataset, and implement a TensorFlow search algorithm for data analysis.

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd odoo-partners-scraper
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Scraper

To run the web scraper and fetch data from the Odoo partners website, execute the following command:

```
python src/scraper.py
```

### Managing the Dataset

After scraping the data, you can manage it using the functions defined in `dataset.py`. This includes saving the data to a file or loading it for further processing.

### TensorFlow Search Algorithm

To use the TensorFlow search algorithm, run the following command:

```
python src/tensorflow_search.py
```

This will build and train a model based on the dataset created from the scraped data, allowing you to perform searches using the trained model.
